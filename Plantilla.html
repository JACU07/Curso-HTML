            <p><em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is simply dummy <strong> text </strong> the printing and typesetting industry.

                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br />
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br />
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br />
                <hr />
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the <br />
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop <br />
