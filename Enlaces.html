    <p><em>Lorem Ipsum</em> is simply dummy <strong> text </strong> the printing and typesetting industry. <br />
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br />
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br />
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br />
        <hr />
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the <br />
        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop <br />
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum<br />
